Original state number was 4782, minimized machine has 2529 states
Compression summary: used 8,382 nextstate entries, plus 126 map entries
- Uncompressed automaton would have -1,477,378,048 nextstate entries
- Input characters are packed into 64 equivalence classes
- CharClass compression 99.99%, 64 entries Vs 1,114,112
- Nextstate table compression 94.82%, 8,382 entries Vs 161,856
- CharacterMap compression is 99.99%, 126 entries Vs 1,114,112
- Decision tree depth is 1

Backup state report --- 
In <0>, after "\t" automaton could accept "{white_space}" in state 1
--- after ''d'' automaton is in a non-accept state and might need to backup

In <0>, after "/#do\x20" automaton could accept "({white_space}|{symbol})#{white_space}*({UNITYBuiltinKeywords}|{HLSLCGBlockKeyWords})({blank}+{words}|{symbol}+)*{white_space}" in state 4
--- after ''/'' automaton is in a non-accept state and might need to backup
